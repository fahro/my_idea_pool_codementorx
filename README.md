# My Idea pool
**My Idea Pool**  is a service that records your ideas! After signing up for an account, users can log their ideas and assign them scores. Every idea contains 3 scores:  **Impact**,  **Ease**  and  **Confidence**. Each idea can be added, edited and deleted. All the ideas will be sorted by the average of all three scores in descending order (i.e., 8, 5, 4). Every API call will return 10 ideas. When not using the service, users can log out of the system.
